## Hi, my name is Ethan Escat

**`Student Interested in the Applicaitons of Software, Robotics, and AI`**

Here in my github you can see all of my latest work and projects. All the projects here are allgined with my interests and how I can bring these interests to life. Etherprint, a website that allows it's users to customize a 3d render of a t-shirt combines my passion for graphic design and software development. It allows me to practice my creativity and help me find my style of what kind of clothing I like. Ethernet was a social media app inspired by my belief that communication is key, we should try to communicate with the people around us as much as possible so apps like social media allows us to communicate even if we are not with the person physically. Currently future projects I am thinking about is a Berkeley restaurant recommendation system and I also want to start doing more hardware projects in the future.
